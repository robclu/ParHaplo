\section{INTRODUCTION}

It is commonly accepted that all humans share $\mathtt{\sim}$99$\%$ of the same DNA, however, small variations 
cause human beings to have different physical traits. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which are
variations of a single DNA base from one individual to another, are believed to be able to address
genetic differences. For diploid organisms, which have pairs of chromosomes, a \textit{haplotype} is a 
sequence of SNPs in each copy of a pair of chromosomes. A \textit{genoype} describes the conflated data of the
haplotypes on a pair of chromosomes. Haplotypes are believed to contain more generic information than
genotypes \cite{stephens:2001}, however, obtaining haplotypes correctly is a difficult problem, which is 
broken into two subdomains: individual haplotype assembly and haplotype inference. \\
Haplotype inference uses the genotype of a set of individuals. The genotype data tells the status of each
allele at a position, but does not distinguish which copy of the chromosome the allele came from.
This negative aspects of this approach are that it cannot distinguish rare and novel SNPs \cite{he:2010}, 
and there is no way of knowing if the inferred haplotype is completely correct. \\
Individual haplotype assembly uses fragments of sequences generated by sequenncing technology to determine
haplotypes. The fragments of a sequence come from the two copies of an individual's chromosome, the goal of the
individual haplotyping problem is to correctly determine two haplotypes, where each haplotype corresponds to
one of the two copies of the chromosome. \\
The haplotype assembly problem was proven to be NP-Hard \cite{lippert:2002}. The algorithms used to solve the
problem are thus computationally complex and until recently, there was nopractical exact algothim to solve 
the problem using Minmum Error Correction (MEC) \cite{bonizzoni:2003},
However, recently an exact soluiton was proposed \cite{chen:2013} which is capable of solving the MEC 
problem exactly and can thus infer all hoaplotypes correctly from the fragment sequences. Furthermore, the
complex nature of the algorithms results in execution times in the range of days for chromosomes with high
errors rates. Using parallel implementation of any of the proposed solutions could raduce the long execution 
times. \\
Parallel programming makes use of devices which have many simple cores, but which can execute the same
instrucitons on each of the cores at the same time. The effectiveness of parallel programming is dependant on
the nature of the problem, as per Amdahl's law. The first attempts at parllel programming came from Graphics
Processin Units (GPUs) which were used to render many pixels simultaneously. More recently, General-Purpose
GPU (GPGPU) programming has become prominent with API's liek CUDA and OpenCL allowing accss to GPUs from C and
C++ programs. \\
